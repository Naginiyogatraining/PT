            Hi, I’m Eudoxia, a qualified personal trainer and I am
            offering an AFFORDABLE professional fitness service in Reading. I
            specialize in helping people like you reach their fitness goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            I noticed you’re interested in getting started with personal
            training, and I wanted to offer my help. Personal Training has been
            shown to be one of the most effective ways to get in shape and
            achieve your fitness goals. 
          </p>
          <p>I use a variety of methods during my sessions such as free bodyweight training, strength and
             conditioning - tailored to the individual's goals - toning or strengthening, to gain more flexibility.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><h2>GYM Sessions</h2></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Get fit, be healthy & feel great with your local personal trainer.
          I would be honored to help you on your
          journey and I would like to take you through a regular PT Taster
          Session and development day at the best local Gym and It’s FREE.          
        </p>
          <p>GYM MEMBERSHIP IS REQUIRED TO TRAIN WITH ME!</p>
          <p>
            "If you do not have a membership jet, but like to attend the
            consultation and the FREE taster session. Please get in
