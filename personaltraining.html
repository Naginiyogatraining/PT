          <p>

          </p>
          <p>
            I noticed you’re interested in getting started with personal
            training, and I wanted to offer my help. Personal Training has been
            shown to be one of the most effective ways to get in shape and
            achieve your fitness goals. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking forward to your goals, you will gradually be able to increase the weight, frequency, or intensity of exercises to ensure visible improvements.
            I use a variety of methods during my sessions, such as free bodyweight training, strength and
             conditioning - tailored to the individual's goals - toning or strengthening, losing weight, to gain more flexibility.
          </p>
