  <h3>Comprehensive Warm-Up and Preparation</h3>
  <p>
    You’ll start with effective warm-up sequences that prepare your shoulders, spine, and hips for backbending. Expect dynamic stretches and mobility drills; such as cat-cow, glute bridges, and lunges to ensure your body is ready for deeper work.
  </p> 
  <h3>Step-by-Step Progressions</h3> 
            <p>
              We’ll break down the mechanics of key backbending poses, from gentle options like cobra and bridge to more advanced shapes. You’ll learn how to engage the right muscles, especially the glutes, core, and back, to support your spine and avoid compression.
            </p>
            <h3>Individual Guidance and Props</h3>
            <p> With a small group setting, you’ll receive personalized feedback and hands-on adjustments as appropriate. Props such as blocks and straps will be used to make backbends accessible and comfortable for everyone, regardless of experience level</p>
            <h3>Mobility and Strength Drills</h3>
            <p>Through targeted exercises, you’ll improve flexibility in your shoulders and hip flexors and build strength in your posterior chain. Drills may include prone shoulder lifts, couch stretches, and thoracic spine mobility work. Each chosen to help you safely progress toward deeper backbends.</p>
          <h3>Breathwork and Body Awareness</h3>
          <p>Breathing techniques will be integrated throughout the session to support healthy spinal movement, enhance focus, and help you relax into each pose. You’ll also develop greater awareness of your body’s limits and learn how to listen to its signals.
