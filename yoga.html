            I offer Hatha Yoga classes for the general public, corporate,
            leisure centres, charities and one to ones. I create a space for
            safe, mindful, and sometimes challenging yoga practice in my yoga
            classes, allowing you to leave each class feeling rejuvenated,
            relaxed and more comfortable in your body and mind. All of my
            classes are open to beginners and more experienced yoga
            practitioners.
          </p>
          <p>Several classes are available throughout the week.</p>

                  Group classes will focus on movements incorporating strength, flexibility & mobility.

            The human body is created to move, and practising Yoga is
            worthwhile. Many diseases and conditions we see in society can be
            prevented simply with regular exercise. It is never too late to
            start working on it. Each yoga pose has a unique intention, a way to
            connect body, mind and spirit with specific needs. It's not just
            about movement, it's about transformation and self-knowledge,
            finding in each asana an energy that balances and inspires us.
