          I offer Hatha Yoga classes for the general public, corporate, leisure centres, charities and one to ones. 
          I create a space for safe, mindful, and sometimes challenging yoga practice in my yoga classes, allowing you to leave each class feeling rejuvenated, relaxed and more comfortable in your body and mind. 
          All of my classes are open to beginners and more experienced yoga practitioners. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Several classes are available throughout the week.

          The human body is created to move, and practising Yoga is worthwhile. 
          Many diseases and conditions we see in society can be prevented simply with regular exercise. 
          It is never too late to start working on it. 
          Each yoga pose has a unique intention, a way to connect body, mind and spirit with specific needs. It's not just about movement, it's about transformation and self-knowledge, finding in each asana an energy that balances and inspires us.
