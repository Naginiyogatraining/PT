          <h3>Rocket Yoga</h3>
            <p>
          The human body is created to move, and practising Yoga is worthwhile.
          Many diseases and conditions we see in society can be prevented simply
          with regular exercise. It is never too late to start working on it.
          Each yoga pose has a unique intention, a way to connect body, mind and
          spirit with specific needs. It's not just about movement, it's about
          transformation and self-knowledge, finding in each asana an energy
          that balances and inspires us. Book now and choose the location that suits you best.
        </p>
        <p>Book yourself and don't miss out!</p>
