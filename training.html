          <h3>CARDIOVASCULAR TRAINING</h3>
          <p>
            Cardiovascular endurance, or aerobic fitness, is how well your heart and lungs can supply the oxygen you need while you exercise at medium to high intensity. If you have good cardiovascular endurance, you can exercise at medium intensity for a long time before it makes you tired. This is because your body is able to keep getting the oxygen it needs during exercise.
        </p>
        <p>Cardio can support fat lossbut should not overshadow the importance of resistance training.</p>

        <p>            Weight training is a primary form of strength training that uses
            weights for resistance. It helps build muscle strength and power
            using free weights (barbells and dumbbells), bodyweight exercises,
            resistance bands, or weight machines.
          </p>
          <p>Effective weight training requires proper technique. Focus on key movement patterns.</p>

<h3>How many times should I workout in a week?</h3>
<p>  Ideally, aim to workout at least three to five days a week. This frequency allows for sufficient recovery between sessions while still providing enough stimulus for your body to adapt and improve. It also ensures that you're consistently working towards your goals without overdoing it and risking burnout or injury.
</p>
<h3>How many times a week should I train each muscle group?</h3>
<p> For muscle growth, it is generally recommended to hit each muscle group two or three times per week. This allows for maximum muscle growth and recovery. However, if you are just starting out, it is best to follow the advice of your trainer and give each muscle group enough time to rest and recover between workouts.
</p>
<h3>  Why is it important for recovery?</h3>
<p>  Rest and recovery allow your tissues to strengthen and heal, in addition to allowing you to restore the energy you lost from working out. A recovery period is necessary for your tissues to become accustomed to this form of exercise, especially if it is something that you will be adopting as a regular workout. When you rest, your muscles start to heal and grow back stronger, meaning you'll be able to do the same workout with less effort in the future.
