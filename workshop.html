            This workshop is designed for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of backbends, whether you’re a beginner or want to refine your technique. We’ll focus on building a strong foundation, emphasizing safe alignment and mindful movement to protect your spine and joints.
          </p>
          <p>Comprehensive Warm-Up and Preparation
            You’ll start with effective warm-up sequences that prepare your shoulders, spine, and hips for backbending. Expect dynamic stretches and mobility drills—such as cat-cow, glute bridges, and lunges—to ensure your body is ready for deeper work.
            
            Step-by-Step Progressions
            We’ll break down the mechanics of key backbending poses, from gentle options like cobra and bridge to more advanced shapes. You’ll learn how to engage the right muscles, especially the glutes, core, and back, to support your spine and avoid compression.
            
            Mobility and Strength Drills
            Through targeted exercises, you’ll improve flexibility in your shoulders and hip flexors and build strength in your posterior chain. Drills may include prone shoulder lifts, couch stretches, and thoracic spine mobility work—each chosen to help you safely progress toward deeper backbends.
            
            Breathwork and Body Awareness
            Breathing techniques will be integrated throughout the session to support healthy spinal movement, enhance focus, and help you relax into each pose. You’ll also develop greater awareness of your body’s limits and learn how to listen to its signals.
            
            Individual Guidance and Props
            With a small group setting, you’ll receive personalized feedback and hands-on adjustments as appropriate. Props such as blocks and straps will be used to make backbends accessible and comfortable for everyone, regardless of experience level</p>
